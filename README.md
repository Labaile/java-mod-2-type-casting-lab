# Type Casting Lab

## Learning Goals

- Explore type casting

## Instructions

Using the hierarchy you created in the "Inheritance Lab", modify your runner so
that it has a variable of the type you defined in your parent class and
instantiate it as an instance of one of your child classes. Then print out the
runtime type of your class to see for yourself that it will be the type of your
child class.
